title: Quick Notes On Git Amending, Squashing & Diffing
date: 3/25/24

 I've been working collaboratively on Drivetracks with a couple people and have forced to improve my git-fu a bit and want to jot down real quick what I've learned.

| description                        | git command                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| change last commit message         | `git commit --amend`                                   |
| change specific commit message     | `git rebase -i HEAD~3`                                 |
| add stuff to the last commit       | `git commit --amend --no-edit`                         |
| sqash last n commits               | `git reset --soft HEAD~n`                              |
| interactive squash                 | `git rebase -i HEAD~n`                                 |
| (...but keep original commit date) | `git rebase -i --committer-date-is-author-date HEAD~n` |
| see a branch's changes             | `git diff main`                                        |
| see a branch's divergent changes   | `git diff main...branch`                               |
| see diff between two commits       | `git diff hash1...hash2`                               |
