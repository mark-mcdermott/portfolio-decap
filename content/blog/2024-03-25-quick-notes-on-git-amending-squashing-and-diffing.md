I learned today a quick way to test a bunch of boolean expressions in Javascript is to put them in an array and use Javascript's `some` or `every` method:

`arr.some(Boolean)`
`arr.every(Boolean)`

`.some(Boolean)` will return true if any element of the array is truthy. `.every(Boolean)` will return true if all elements in the array are truthy.
